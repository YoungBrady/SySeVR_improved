# SySeVR docker image instructions

*Reminder: the device needs nvdia graphics card support, and docker and nvidia-docker2 have been installed in Linux system*

## 1) Build image

The docker_build folder is the working folder where the image is created.

Enter docker_ Build folder, execute command:

```bash
docker build -t sysevr:v1.0 .
```

"sysevr: v1.0" is the name of the created image.

## 2) Run container

execute command:

```bash
docker run -itd --gpus all --name=sysevr -v /home/docker_mapping/Implementation:/home/SySeVR/Implementation -v /home/docker_mapping/data:/home/SySeVR/data sysevr:v1.0 /bin/bash
```

"--name=sysevr",sysevr is the container name.

"sysevr:v1.0" is the image name obtained in the previous step.

After entering the container, the folders of Joern and neo4j software required by sysevr are under the path of / home/sysevr.
Other required dependencies have been installed and configured.
